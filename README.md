# Welcome to Team 3's Data Science Industry Project

This repository is about the project we are currently working on is "Tweets Sentiment Analysis Application using Twitter API".

## Project scope

The aim of this project is to build an application that is capable of fast, real-time sentiment analysis of tweets with regards to the important conflict currently happening in Ukraine between Ukraine and Russia. The scope might cover anything between the energy crisis cause by the war to the world relations between states, especially the two currently implicated in the military confilct.

## Structure

This project is made up of two main stages:

 - the data pipeline that uses the Twitter API to extract, transform and load the data
 - the App that will generate real-time sentiment scores for the selected criteria
